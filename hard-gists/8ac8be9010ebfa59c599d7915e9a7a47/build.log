#7 3.467       The 'sklearn' PyPI package is deprecated, use 'scikit-learn'
#7 3.467       rather than 'sklearn' for pip commands.
#7 3.467       
#7 3.467       Here is how to fix this error in the main use cases:
#7 3.467       - use 'pip install scikit-learn' rather than 'pip install sklearn'
#7 3.467       - replace 'sklearn' by 'scikit-learn' in your pip requirements files
#7 3.467         (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg, Pipfile, etc ...)
#7 3.467       - if the 'sklearn' package is used by one of your dependencies,
#7 3.467         it would be great if you take some time to track which package uses
#7 3.467         'sklearn' instead of 'scikit-learn' and report it to their issue tracker
#7 3.467       - as a last resort, set the environment variable
#7 3.467         SKLEARN_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SKLEARN_PACKAGE_INSTALL=True to avoid this error
#7 3.467
