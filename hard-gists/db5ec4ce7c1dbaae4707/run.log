Traceback (most recent call last):
        PIP package scapy-python3 used to provide scapy3k, which was a fork from scapy implementing python3 compatibility since 2016. This package was included in some of the Linux distros under name of python3-scapy. Starting from scapy version 2.4 (released in March, 2018) mainstream scapy supports python3. To reduce any confusion scapy3k was renamed to kamene.

    from scapy.all import *
You should use either pip package kamene for scapy3k (see http://github.com/phaethon/kamene for differences in use) or mainstream scapy (pip package scapy, http://github.com/secdev/scapy).
