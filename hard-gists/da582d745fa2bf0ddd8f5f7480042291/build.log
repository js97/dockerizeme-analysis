#8 4.486                          CMake is not installed on your system!
#8 4.486       
#8 4.486           Or it is possible some broken copy of cmake is installed on your system.
#8 4.486           It is unfortunately very common for python package managers to include
#8 4.486           broken copies of cmake.  So if the error above this refers to some file
#8 4.486           path to a cmake file inside a python or anaconda or miniconda path then you
#8 4.486           should delete that broken copy of cmake from your computer.
#8 4.486       
#8 4.486           Instead, please get an official copy of cmake from one of these known good
#8 4.486           sources of an official cmake:
#8 4.486               - cmake.org (this is how windows users should get cmake)
#8 4.486               - apt install cmake (for Ubuntu or Debian based systems)
#8 4.486               - yum install cmake (for Redhat or CenOS based systems)
#8 4.486       
#8 4.486           On a linux machine you can run `which cmake` to see what cmake you are
#8 4.486           actually using.  If it tells you it's some cmake from any kind of python
#8 4.486           packager delete it and install an official cmake.
#8 4.486       
#8 4.486           More generally, cmake is not installed if when you open a terminal window
#8 4.486           and type
#8 4.486              cmake --version
#8 4.486           you get an error.  So you can use that as a very basic test to see if you
#8 4.486           have cmake installed.  That is, if cmake --version doesn't run from the
#8 4.486           same terminal window from which you are reading this error message, then
#8 4.486           you have not installed cmake.  Windows users should take note that they
#8 4.486           need to tell the cmake installer to add cmake to their PATH.  Since you
#8 4.486           can't run commands that are not in your PATH.  This is how the PATH works
#8 4.486           on Linux as well, but failing to add cmake to the PATH is a particularly
#8 4.486           common problem on windows and rarely a problem on Linux.
