#9 0.889       # `ldap` on PyPI
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       This dummy project is not installable.
#9 0.889       You probably want `python-ldap` instead.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       ### python-ldap
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       The widely used [python-ldap](https://python-ldap.org) project provides
#9 0.889       an importable module named `ldap`.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       This goes against the convention that PyPI distribution names should
#9 0.889       match the module names.
#9 0.889       But, python-ldap pre-dates wide use of that convention, and the issue
#9 0.889       is hard to fix now.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       Please install `python-ldap` to get the LDAP bindings.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       ### ldap 1.0
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       The `ldap` name on PyPI was used for an unrelated collection of
#9 0.889       LDAP-related utilities, which is not as popular, and confused users who
#9 0.889       install `ldap` to get the `ldap` module.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       The project is no longer developed.
#9 0.889       It is archived as `1.0.x` releases on PyPI, and on
#9 0.889       [GitHub](https://github.com/andreif/ldap).
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       ## Why we don't fix this transparently
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       This could have been a placeholder  package that depends on `python-ldap`,
#9 0.889       saving you the trouble of reading this message.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       However, `pip` [has trouble](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4961)
#9 0.889       with differently-named packages that provide the same module.
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       ## Please: Don't install packages blindly
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       When you see the exception:
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       ```
#9 0.889       ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foo'
#9 0.889       ```
#9 0.889       
#9 0.889       … please research the actual requirements instead of going directly for
#9 0.889       `pip install foo`.
#9 0.889       The project (distribution) name may differ from the module(s) it
#9 0.889       provides.
