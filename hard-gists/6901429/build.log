#8 2.366       The 'sklearn' PyPI package is deprecated, use 'scikit-learn'
#8 2.366       rather than 'sklearn' for pip commands.
#8 2.366       
#8 2.366       Here is how to fix this error in the main use cases:
#8 2.366       - use 'pip install scikit-learn' rather than 'pip install sklearn'
#8 2.366       - replace 'sklearn' by 'scikit-learn' in your pip requirements files
#8 2.366         (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg, Pipfile, etc ...)
#8 2.366       - if the 'sklearn' package is used by one of your dependencies,
#8 2.366         it would be great if you take some time to track which package uses
#8 2.366         'sklearn' instead of 'scikit-learn' and report it to their issue tracker
#8 2.366       - as a last resort, set the environment variable
#8 2.366         SKLEARN_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SKLEARN_PACKAGE_INSTALL=True to avoid this error
#8 2.366
