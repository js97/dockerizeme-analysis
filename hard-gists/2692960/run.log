Use --list to see the categories available and --get to download the music from said categories.
When specifying categories, you can list multiple or 'all'.
Sorry there's no tagging, I hope your media player can use the directory structure fot figure the tags out. A sauce.txt file is included along with every 'album' which links to the source and includes the non-sanitized track names.
This script supports very limited resuming in case of a failed download.
